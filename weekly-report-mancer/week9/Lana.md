# Weekly Report — Lana (Week 9)

**Scope:** BE-DB-SC-Merkle — backend API (`apps/web/src/app/api/`), Postgres/indexer (`apps/web/src/lib/db/`, `src/lib/indexer/`), Solana program (`programs/vesting/`), and the Merkle client/verifier (`clients/ts/`, `programs/vesting/src/math/`). Frontend UI is Geral's; I touch it only where a fix is SC/BE-coupled.

**Week 9 was the documentation week.** The scholarship `task.md` KPI: *a developer who has never seen the code can integrate with the program using only the docs.* I shipped those documentation deliverables **and** ran a parallel detect → triage → fix → docs hardening pass across SC / BE / Merkle.

**This week (chronological):** opened with the SC hardening — `91fefa1` fixed SC-FIND-02 (native-SOL `withdraw_unvested` now preserves `rent_min` so the VestingTree PDA isn't GC'd, High→Low) and SC-FIND-03 (`withdraw` gains the `!instant_refunded` guard, Medium). `81e93f9` then closed the three BE findings — BE-SEC-01 (POST `/api/campaigns` now unconditionally requires wallet auth + `signer===creator`, **High**), BE-SEC-05 (rate limiter wrapped in try/catch with in-memory fallback, Medium), BE-SEC-06 (cron secret compared with `timingSafeCompare`, Low) — with `46472af` aligning the bankrun test to the rent-preservation fix. `fe22cc5` added the test backstop (+901 LOC test-only): Rust proptests for merkle forgery + schedule overspend, the `withdraw_unvested.rs` Mollusk audit file, TS fast-check merkle-parity, and BE route security tests. Then the documentation deliverables landed in `cc0e3f4` — `INSTRUCTION_REFERENCE.md`, `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`, three ADRs, and `BUG_LIST.md` — followed by `29a9a3b` (repeatable Vercel deploy tooling) and `067603e` (CU bench refresh for 2026-06-15). I closed the week reconciling stale test counts across the docs (working-tree updates, 2026-06-15) so README/TESTING/E2E/PENDING_WORK reflect the verified Mollusk (73 active / 18 ignored), bench (10/1), and proptest (18 invariants) numbers. The week then closed out (2026-06-16) by **reversing the Issue #29 deferral**: `fd6163d` ships the on-chain fix — `ClaimRecord` becomes `#[account(zero_copy)]` with a bounded per-leaf ledger (`leaf_claimed_idx`/`leaf_claimed_amt`, `PER_LEAF_CAP=8`) so a multi-leaf beneficiary is paid each leaf in full (ADR-003 superseded). `09e49a8` makes the cliff/linear schedule **campaign-level** — one shared Start/Cliff/End stamped per leaf so unequal-amount recipients (0.5 vs 1 SOL) unlock together (FE create-flow + CSV only; on-chain math unchanged; +4 regression tests). `92b3868` synced the IDL + E2E tests to the campaign-level schedule, and `16c401c` switched `claim`/`withdraw`/`cancel_stream` to `load_init` for the zero-copy `ClaimRecord` (init_if_needed leaves the discriminator zeroed until exit) and aligned the close-claim-record E2E mock to the 232-byte v1 layout.

## Status — What works and what doesn't

### Working

| Area | Item | Evidence |
|------|------|----------|
| **SC** | `withdraw_unvested` (native SOL) preserves `rent_min`; PDA no longer GC'd | `91fefa1` — `programs/vesting/src/instructions/withdraw_unvested.rs`; `tests/vesting-native-sol.spec.ts` |
| **SC** | `withdraw` blocks `instant_refunded` trees (defense-in-depth, mirrors `claim`) | `91fefa1` — `programs/vesting/src/instructions/withdraw.rs` |
| **BE** | POST `/api/campaigns` requires wallet auth + `signer===creator` (BE-SEC-01) | `81e93f9` — `apps/web/src/app/api/campaigns/route.ts`; `BE-SEC-01` 401/403 in `apps/web/tests/api/security.test.ts` |
| **BE** | Rate limiter degrades gracefully on Upstash error (BE-SEC-05) | `81e93f9` — `apps/web/src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts` |
| **BE** | Cron secret compared constant-time (BE-SEC-06) | `81e93f9` — `apps/web/src/app/api/cron/sync/route.ts` |
| **Tests** | Rust proptests: 18 property invariants (schedule 10 + merkle 8) + 24 unit | `fe22cc5` — `programs/vesting/src/math/{schedule,merkle}.rs`; `cargo test --lib` |
| **Tests** | `withdraw_unvested.rs` Mollusk audit (3 active: drain-to-rent, grace-fail, reinit) | `fe22cc5` — `programs/vesting/tests/withdraw_unvested.rs` |
| **Tests** | TS fast-check merkle-parity (7/7: Rust↔Client↔Web byte-identical) | `fe22cc5` — `clients/ts/src/__tests__/merkle-properties.test.ts` |
| **Docs** | Instruction reference — all 18 instructions, error codes 6000–6041, 12 events, per-instruction TS examples | `cc0e3f4` — `docs/week9/INSTRUCTION_REFERENCE.md` |
| **Docs** | Integration guide — prepare → create → fund → register → claim walkthrough | `cc0e3f4` — `docs/week9/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` |
| **Docs** | 3 ADRs — merkle-compressed vesting, keccak-256 domain separation, Issue #29 on-chain fix (ADR-003 since **superseded — shipped** `fd6163d`) | `cc0e3f4` — `docs/week9/ADRs/ADR-{001,002,003}*.md` |
| **Docs** | Bug list — full finding log across SC/MERKLE/BE/DB with fix/rationale | `cc0e3f4` — `docs/week9/BUG_LIST.md` |
| **Bench** | CU budget re-measured on Solana CLI 3.1.12 (Agave); 10 active + 1 ignored | `067603e` — `programs/vesting/benches/compute_units.md`; `docs/CU_BUDGET.md` |
| **Ops** | Repeatable Vercel deploy (`pnpm deploy:web`, `vercel:link`) | `29a9a3b` — `apps/web/.vercel/project.json`, root `package.json` |
| **Merkle** | Merkle surface independently audited — **sound** (5 findings, no exploit path) | `docs/week9/BUG_LIST.md` §MERKLE; golden-hash cross-check + 6 forgery PoCs all rejected |
| **Docs-sync** | Test-count claims reconciled across README/TESTING/E2E/PENDING_WORK | working tree (2026-06-15, pending commit) — Mollusk 72→73 / 7→8 files, bench 9→10, proptest corrected |
| **SC** | **Issue #29 fixed on-chain** — `ClaimRecord` is `#[account(zero_copy)]` with a bounded per-leaf ledger (`leaf_claimed_idx`/`leaf_claimed_amt`, `PER_LEAF_CAP=8`); a multi-leaf beneficiary is paid each leaf in full | `fd6163d` — `programs/vesting/src/state/claim_record.rs`; two-leaf regression test chaining two claims (both pay 1200/1200) |
| **FE/BE-coupled** | Cliff/linear schedule is **campaign-level** — one shared Start/Cliff/End stamped per leaf; unequal-amount recipients unlock together (FE create-flow + CSV only; on-chain math unchanged) | `09e49a8` — `apps/web/src/app/(app)/campaign/create/{linear,cliff}/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/lib/campaign/bulk.ts` |

### Incomplete / deferred

| Item | Owner | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Remove obsolete BE `cliffLinearSeen` guards (prepare/import) — post-deploy follow-up | Lana | Issue #29 is **fixed on-chain** (`fd6163d`); the BE prepare/import guards that reject multi cliff/linear per beneficiary are now redundant but remain **active** until a follow-up post-deploy PR removes them (`apps/web/src/app/api/campaigns/{prepare,import}/route.ts`). ADR-003 (superseded) documents the rationale. |
| Mollusk coverage of 4 handlers (`claim`, `cancel_stream`, `instant_refund`, `withdraw_unvested`) | Lana | Blocked on Mollusk 0.14 (`init_if_needed` / `Optional<T>` resolution). 19 `#[ignore]`d tests unblock then. `withdraw_unvested` native path is covered via the new audit file. |
| BE route-level tests (`apps/web/tests/api/**`, incl. BE-SEC-01 401/403 + rate-limit cluster) | Lana | Staged, but need a running Postgres to execute; not yet runnable in CI. |
| Prod deployment (`velthoryn.vercel.app`) | Ops | Returns `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` — redeploy required (README §Vercel has the runbook; `29a9a3b` adds the one-liner). |
| Sentry DSN in Vercel production | Ops | Monitoring configured but DSN not set in prod env. |
| External audit ($15–40k) | Budget | Approval needed before engagement. |

## What the documentation week delivered

This section maps each `task.md` acceptance criterion to the concrete artifact that satisfies it. **The documentation-week KPI is met.**

| `task.md` criterion | Delivered | How it satisfies the KPI |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Instruction reference (params, behavior, error codes, examples) | `docs/week9/INSTRUCTION_REFERENCE.md` | All 18 instructions + view fn; full error table (6000–6041, 42 variants); 12 events; per-instruction TS examples (added this pass to cover every instruction). |
| Integration guide (working code snippets) | `docs/week9/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | End-to-end creator + beneficiary walkthrough (prepare → create → fund → register → claim → cancel), runnable TS, SPL + native SOL. |
| ≥3 architecture decision records | `docs/week9/ADRs/ADR-001|002|003` | (1) Merkle-compressed vesting, (2) keccak-256 + domain separation, (3) Issue #29 on-chain fix (ADR-003, **superseded — shipped** `fd6163d`). |
| README accuracy | `README.md`, `docs/CU_BUDGET.md`, `docs/TESTING.md` | Week-9 status section + this session's count reconciliation (Mollusk 73/18, bench 10/1, proptest 18). |
| KPI: unfamiliar dev can integrate from docs alone | above + `BUG_LIST.md` | A reader can derive PDAs, build a Merkle tree, submit a claim, and handle errors without reading source. |
| Marketing teammate review of the integration guide | **pending — teammate TBD** | `task.md` criterion; not yet done. The integration guide is ready for review; this is a human/process step outside the repo. |

## Blockers — What's stuck or what you need

No blockers in BE-DB-SC-Merkle that I can resolve with code alone. The open items are upstream or budget-gated.

| Dependency | Who | What |
|------------|-----|------|
| Mollusk 0.14 upstream release | anza-xyz | Unblocks 4 SC handlers + the 19 ignored tests (`init_if_needed` / `Optional<T>`). |
| Prod redeploy | Ops | `velthoryn.vercel.app` is down; runbook + `pnpm deploy:web` ready (`29a9a3b`). |
| External audit budget | Budget | $15–40k approval before engagement. |
| BE route tests infra | Lana | Need local/CI Postgres to execute the staged route tests. |

## Metrics — Quantifiable progress

| Metric | End of Week 8 | Week 9 Delta |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| SC `cargo test` | 110 passed / 19 ignored | **+16** → 126 passed / 0 failed / 19 ignored (Issue #29 two-leaf regression) |
| Mollusk CU bench (active) | 9 + 1 ignored | **+1** → 10 active + 1 ignored |
| Rust proptest invariants | (none) | **+18** (schedule 10 + merkle 8) |
| TS fast-check properties | (none) | **+7** (merkle parity, new) |
| Mollusk test files | 7 | **+1** → 8 (`withdraw_unvested.rs`) |
| Web Vitest (unit, `vitest.unit.config.ts`) | 565/565 | **+4** → 569/569 (campaign-level schedule regression tests) |
| TS merkle parity | 13/13 | unchanged (13/13) |
| Docs shipped (week9/) | 0 | **+5** (INSTRUCTION_REFERENCE, INTEGRATION_GUIDE, BUG_LIST, 3 ADRs) |
| SC/BE security fixes applied | — | **5** (BE-SEC-01/05/06, SC-FIND-02/03) |
| Bootcamp acceptance | 8/8 | unchanged (8/8) |

## What's Next (Week 10+)

### SC — Solana Program
- [x] **Issue #29 on-chain fix shipped** — `fd6163d`: per-leaf claimed tracking via zero-copy `ClaimRecord` bounded ledger (`PER_LEAF_CAP=8`). ADR-003 superseded.
- [ ] **Mollusk 0.14 unblock** — lift the 19 ignored tests + add coverage for `claim`/`cancel_stream`/`instant_refund`/`withdraw_unvested` SPL paths.
- [ ] **Token-2022** mint support (Phase 5).
- [ ] **Squads v4 multisig** for `cancel_authority` (Phase 5).
- [ ] **Pinocchio** performance rewrite for CU headroom (Phase 5).
- [x] **SC-FIND-02/03 fixed** — `91fefa1`.

### BE — Backend API
- [ ] **BE route tests** — execute staged `apps/web/tests/api/**` against Postgres in CI (incl. BE-SEC-01 401/403 + rate-limit cluster).
- [ ] **BE-SEC-02/04** — XFF trust + Redis-prod assertion; revisit if moving off Vercel.
- [ ] **BE-SEC-07/08** — nonce binding + CSP tightening (needs FE regression testing first).
- [x] **BE-SEC-01/05/06 fixed** — `81e93f9`.
- [ ] **Remove obsolete BE `cliffLinearSeen` guards** (prepare/import) — follow-up post-deploy PR now that Issue #29 is fixed on-chain (`fd6163d`).

### FE — Frontend
- [x] **Issue #29 FE validation** — **no longer needed**: the on-chain fix (`fd6163d`) pays each leaf in full, so the FE/BE rejection of multi cliff/linear per beneficiary is obsolete (BE-guard removal tracked above).

### CI
- [ ] **Add `test:sc` script** with `BPF_OUT_DIR` so Mollusk tests run without manual env (SC-ENV-01).
- [ ] **Add `deny.toml`** to resolve cargo-deny advisories/licenses FAIL (SC-DEP-02).
- [ ] **Postgres service for BE route tests** in `lint.yml`/`web-ci.yml`.

### Security & Ops
- [ ] **Prod redeploy** — restore `velthoryn.vercel.app` via `pnpm deploy:web` (`29a9a3b`).
- [ ] **Sentry DSN** in Vercel production env.
- [ ] **External audit** ($15–40k) — secure budget, engage firm.
- [ ] **SC dependency advisories** (curve25519-dalek, ed25519-dalek, rand 0.7.3) — transitive; track Solana SDK upgrade (SC-DEP-01).
- [x] **Repeatable Vercel deploy tooling** — `29a9a3b`.
